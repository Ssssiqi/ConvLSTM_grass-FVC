# A ConvLSTM model for predicting fractional grass cover

## Overview
The code demonstrates the Keras implementation of the ConvLSTM model as prospsed in paper "***Deep learning identifies the dominant role of river flow management in grassland recovery in the Gobi Desert***" published in *Geophysical Research Letters*.[[link to the paper]](https://doi.org/XXXXX)

## Quick Start

The code was tested with Python 3.6. To use this code, please do:

1. Install dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install numpy==1.16.4 pandas scipy tensorflow==1.14 keras==2.3.1 matplotlib jupyter scikit-learn
   ```
   
2. Download data sets: 
   
   The Landsat-7 product from [Google Earth Engine platform](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/landsat-7)
